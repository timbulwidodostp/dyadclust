This is a drop-in replacement for {cmd:shell} that works on all platforms and modes.
Normally it just passes the {it:command} on to {cmd:shell}. But in batch-mode on Windows {cmd:shell} doesn't work 
(commands are ignored) and so in these cases we use a compiled plugin to launch the process using win32 API.
If you need to invoke {cmd:cmd} (for example to handle redirections), 
you can call {cmd:bshell cmd /c ...}, though note that if {cmd:...} starts and ends
with double quotes, then {cmd:cmd} will strip them (so you might have to add extras).
